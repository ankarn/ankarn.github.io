# Welcome to our lab

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ankarn/ankarn.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

## Here we will share the workflows we are using

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ankarn/ankarn.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Genome assembly

We are using several **assemblers**

1. SOAPdenovo
[SOAPdenovo](https://github.com/aquaskyline/SOAPdenovo2)

2. SPADes

I can start with that command line, -o output, -t numer of threads
`<spades -k 21,33,55,77,99,127 --only-assembler -o -1 -2 -t 4 `

3. MIRA


As Kanye West said:

I think that is all for now, I will continue developing the site very soon.
